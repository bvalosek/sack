## Installation

```
npm install sack
```

## Introduction

This is a simple *Inversion of Control Container*. It provides the mechanism
you need to have a centralized store of lazily-created, dynamically resolved
object instances that other types can passively request get injected.

This means that you can have objects use, access, or compose other objects
without having to explicitly know how to create/setup/initialize them.

It lets you have a highly-decoupled and framework-independent domain objects.

### Philosophy

As with any IoC container, you want to only have your code be aware of the
container the topmost/single entry point that bootstraps the rest of your
application.

It is very much so an antipattern to have traces of the IoC container all over your
codebase. The idea is to allow your business logic and domain classes to be
**totally unaware** that they are getting injected by a container, keeping them
free of Sack-specific code.

This is done by  embracing and reifying the pattern of *dependency injection
via constructor parameters*. Instead of having all of your objects be aware of
how to find, access, setup, initialize, and manage other objects, they simply
implicitly state their need for a dependency as a constructor parameter.

It allows your business logic classes to go from this:

```javascript
function UserController()
{
  var connection = new DbConnection(global.settings.conConfig);
  this.users = connection.selectUsers();
}
```

To this:

```javascript
function UserController(users)
{
  this.users = users;
}

```

This removes the knowledge and logic from `UserController` on how to connect to
a database.

In large applications, things like model stores, application
configs, service handles, etc. are all used across several different parts of
an application. Relying on every consumer object to manage its dependencies
violates [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) and
[SRP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), making
your codebase difficult to maintain as it scales.

The goal is to reduce how tightly coupled your various objects are by removing
the knowledge of *how to create* other dependency objects, and simply rely on
expressing *what kind* of objects we need.

This facilitates testing, as complex dependencies that are injected can be
substituted with [mocks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object), and the
consuming classes are not tied to a specific implementation.

## Usage

All dependencies should be managed from a single `Container` instance:

```javascript
var Container = require('sack');

var container = new Container();
```

### Registering Objects

Register a class constructor that will get executed every time the dependency
is resolved, creating a new instance:

```javascript
container.register('service', MyService);
```

Register a constructor function that will get executed *one time* when the
first time the dependency is resolved, and then re-used after that (singleton
pattern, lazily created):

```javascript
container.register('service', MyService).asSingleton();
```

Register an existing object instance as a dependency:

```javascript
container.register('service', someService).asInstance();
```

Register a (lazily evaluated) callback to provide the dependency on every
request:

```javascript
container.register('service', function() {
  return new MyService();
});
```

Registered a callback to provide the dependency the first time it is requested,
and then re-use it all subsequent times (lazily-created singleton via callback):

```javascript
container.register('service', function() {
  return new MyService();
}).asSingleton();

```

### Resolving Objects

You can create / request objects via the `make()` function by passing in the
string tag used during registration:

```javascript
var service = container.make('service');
```

Not that you should typically not be using Sack this way, but rather expressing
dependencies as explained below.

### Expressing Dependencies

Whenever Sack creates an object, it satisfies that object's dependencies by
resolving them out of the container as well.

An object expresses its dependency as a constructor parameter, whose name must
match a registered object.

```javascript
function UserEditController(users)
{
  this.users = users;
}

UserEditController.prototype.refreshUsers()
{
  this.users.refresh();
}
```

Assuming we have registered some implementation for `users`:

```javascript
container.register('users', LocalStorageUsers).asSingleton();
```

Then making `UserEditController` via the container will resolve the dependency
automatically.

```
var controller = container.make(UserEditController);
```

### Strong vs Weak Dependencies

By default, all registered dependencies are considered "strong", that is, they
cannot be overridden. Attempting to register a dependency with the same name as
another one will result in an error:

```javascript
container.register('server', express());
container.register('server', http.createServer());

> Error: Cannot override: server
```

Registering a dependency as weak allows it to be overriden later:


```javascript
container.register('config', {}).asWeak();
container.register('config', new ConfigStore());

// No error
```

## Container Methods

### register(tag: string, thing:any): IocBinding

Registers a new dependency `thing` with name `tag` and returns an `IoCBinding`.

`thing` could be an object instance, an object constructor function, or a
closure. See *Registering Objects* above for examples.

### make(tag:string): object

Will resolve / create an object instance out of the container based on what was
registered with `tag`.

See *Resolving Objects* above.

### make(T:constructor): object

Will create a new object instance via the object constructor `Ctor` (e.g, `new
Ctor()`).

Any constructor parameters will be resolved out of the container. See
*Expressing Dependencies* above.

### getFactory(): function

Returns a bound function that can be used as the container's `make` method.

This is useful for passing around a single function to other objects that can
use a factory to construct child objects.

```javascript
var factory = container.getFactory();

var users = factory(UserCollection);

var log = factory('logger');
```

## IoCBinding Methods

The following methods all return the `this` instance of the `IoCBinding` object
it was called on.

### asSingleton()

Ensure that this bindings corresponding dependency is only created once. All
subsequent requests will return the already created object.

```javascript
container.register('router', UrlRouter).asSingleton();
```

### asInstance()

Mark this dependency as simply referencing an already-existing object instance.
This is implicitly called if the containers registers a dependency that is not
a function.

```javascript
container.register('router', myRouter).asInstance();
```

Not that is isn't usually necesary to call this unless the instance you are
registering is a function object, but it doesn't hurt to be explicit.

### asWeak()

Allow this dependency to get overriden at a later time. See *Strong vs Weak
Dependencies* above.
